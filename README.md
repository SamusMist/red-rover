# ðŸš€ Red Rover ðŸš€
Ever wonder what a day on Mars looks like?
With <strong>[Red Rover]()</strong> you can now do just that. On the landing page, you will see four of NASA's Mars rovers: Spirit, Opportunity, Perseverance, and Curiosity. Once you have selected the rover's images that you would like to see, you will be prompted to select a date. But be careful, rovers take days off to charge, and some  of the rovers missions are complete.

Opportunity was lost in a dust storm in 2018 and its twin Spirit passed away in 2010. Both were launched in 2004. Fun fact, did you know that the missions of Spirit and Opportunity were expect to be 100 sols? Opportunity survived 14 years and 5,110 sols!

Anyway, once you select a rover and a date you can hit that submit button and see all of the groundbreaking images that your rover took on that day! Don't want to see sky shots? Don't like some of the images? Upon hover, each image will display which camera on the rover took the image, and the option to remove the image on click. Enjoy your days on Mars, who knows what you will find? ðŸ‘½
